  },
  {
    "id": 24,
    "question": "Why is it easier to jump on the Moon?",
    "answer": "The Moon's weaker gravity (about 1/6 of Earth's) means less downward pull, so jumps reach greater height and distance for the same effort."
  },
  {
    "id": 25,
    "question": "Is there air on the Moon?",
    "answer": "No, the Moon lacks a breathable atmosphere; it has only a very thin exosphere, so humans need life support to breathe there."

  },
  {
    "id": 38,
    "question": "Why is the sky blue during the day?",
    "answer": "Earth's atmosphere scatters shorter blue wavelengths of sunlight more than red, so the sky appears blue during the day."
  },
  {
    "id": 39,
    "question": "Why is space black?",
