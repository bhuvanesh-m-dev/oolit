## 🌌 Overview

Oolit is the dedicated Machine Learning core within the **CosmoTalker** ecosystem.  
It serves as the foundational engine powering space‑focused reasoning, natural language understanding, and generative intelligence built specifically for astronomy, astrophysics, and space‑exploration topics.

This repository contains the evolving machine‑learning components, including:

- LoRA‑trained models  
- Tokenizer configurations  
- Training metadata  
- Model architecture notes  

All contents are part of the CosmoTalker ecosystem and are continuously refined to expand its space‑oriented intelligence capabilities.

## 🚀 Vision

Oolit aims to enable:

- High‑quality space Q&A modeling  
- Educational and research‑friendly ML tools  
- Local and open ML deployments  
- Future integration with PyLlamaUI, Ollama, and browser extensions
